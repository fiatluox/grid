Layout Grid
=========

This project is a little JavaScript that uses a canvas tag to draw a grid on your page to help with alignment issues.  There are some good browser plugins for drawing a grid on your pages, but I wanted something I could integrate to my applications so I could check the grid across all browsers.

Feel free to take the code, copy it into your project, customize your grid, and make something beautiful.
